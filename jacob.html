            <h1>About Jacob</h1>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Andrew Zambazos, a passionate Game Designer from Palmerston North, New Zealand. With 9 years of experience, I've dedicated myself to crafting immersive gaming experiences using Unreal Engine and Unity. As the Lead Level Designer and Project Lead for the "Fallout: Wastelands" mod, I led a talented team to bring an immersive world to life within the Fallout universe. I'm currently the Studio Lead and Producer at Olympus Studios, working on an innovative game called Elysium, which pushes boundaries in story and world design.</p>
            <p>Beyond my professional life, I'm a proud member of the Palmerston North Brass Band, where I play the Double B Flat Tuba. It's a great way for me to unwind and connect with fellow musicians. I'm always excited to connect with fellow gamers and industry enthusiasts. Thanks for joining me on this journey, and let's continue pushing boundaries and creating unforgettable experiences together!</p>
